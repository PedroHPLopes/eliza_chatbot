# Eliza Chatbot Replica with ChatGPT

This project replicates the [Eliza](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/365153.365168) chatbot, originally developed by Joseph Weizenbaum in the 1960s, using the [OpenAI ChatGPT API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/overview). The purpose of this project is to compare the progress of chatbots over the years and showcase how modern technology can be used to recreate historical advancements in the field of artificial intelligence.

## Eliza Chatbot

Eliza was an early example of a computer program designed to simulate human conversation. Developed in the mid-1960s by Joseph Weizenbaum at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Eliza was designed to mimic a Rogerian psychotherapist. The program used pattern matching and simple transformations to engage in text-based conversations with users. Eliza's responses often reflected back the user's input, creating the illusion of understanding and empathy.

## Features

- Users can choose to input their own OpenAI API key or use the creator's key for interacting with the ChatGPT API.
- The application provides a user-friendly interface for chatting with the Eliza chatbot.
- Responses from the chatbot are generated using the OpenAI ChatGPT API, which leverages advanced language models to simulate human-like conversations.
